Fields
Fields must be tab-separated. Also, all but the final field in each feature line must contain a value; "empty" columns should be denoted with a '.'

seqname - name of the chromosome or scaffold; chromosome names can be given with or without the 'chr' prefix. Important note: the seqname must be one used within Ensembl, i.e. a standard chromosome name or an Ensembl identifier such as a scaffold ID, without any additional content such as species or assembly. See the example GFF output below.
source - name of the program that generated this feature, or the data source (database or project name)
feature - feature type name, e.g. Gene, Variation, Similarity
start - Start position of the feature, with sequence numbering starting at 1.
end - End position of the feature, with sequence numbering starting at 1.
score - A floating point value.
strand - defined as + (forward) or - (reverse).
frame - One of '0', '1' or '2'. '0' indicates that the first base of the feature is the first base of a codon, '1' that the second base is the first base of a codon, and so on..
attribute - A semicolon-separated list of tag-value pairs, providing additional information about each feature.
